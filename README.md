# Donut C

This project is a C implementation of the famous "donut" algorithm, which renders a 3D donut shape using ASCII characters in the console. The code is based on optimization techniques outlined by Andy Sloane in his blog post titled ["A journey to the center of the donut"](https://www.a1k0n.net/2021/01/13/optimizing-donut.html). Additionally, it is compatible with cm-console, providing a seamless experience within the console environment.

## Overview

The donut algorithm is a mesmerizing piece of code that generates a spinning donut shape using ASCII characters. It's a beautiful example of how clever mathematics and programming can create stunning visual effects with minimal resources. This project aims to recreate this algorithm in C while incorporating optimizations outlined by Andy Sloane.

## Compatibility

This implementation is designed to work in a console environment and is compatible with cm-console, a console graphics library. It should work in most terminal emulators and command-line interfaces that support cm-console.
